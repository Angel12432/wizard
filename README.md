# 🧙 Wizard simulation project: Aggressive playing behavior

This repository contains a Python program for **simulating the card game Wizard** in order to investigate the success rate of an aggressive playing strategy.

The simulation plays 1000 complete games.There can be between 3 to 6 players. One specific player consistently follows an aggressive playing style. At the end, the console displays the aggressive player's win rate as a percentage.
